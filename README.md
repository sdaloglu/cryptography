## Project Description

This project implements a cryptographic decryption algorithm based on a Markov Chain model of letter transitions. The program processes text data to determine the likelihood of letter sequences in English and uses simulated annealing to optimize a key for decrypting encoded text. The key approach centers on finding an optimal solution to maximize the total probability of the decrypted text matching English language structures.

## Code Architecture

### 1. Input Data Management

The text for *War and Peace* is loaded and analyzed to determine the frequency of letter transitions in the English language. A Markov Chain transition matrix (M) is built to represent the likelihood that one letter follows another. The text data undergoes preprocessing, including conversion to lowercase and filtering out non-alphabet characters.

### 2. Generating a Key

The function `generate_key` creates a random mapping of the alphabet, which serves as the initial decryption key. This key is refined through optimization to maximize the decryption accuracy.

### 3. Calculating Probabilities (`P_calculation`)

The function `P_calculation` computes the total probability, P, of the decrypted phrase matching English letter transition probabilities from the Markov matrix. This serves as the optimization target during simulated annealing.

### 4. Simulated Annealing and Key Optimization (`optimal_swap`)

The `optimal_swap` function uses simulated annealing to iteratively improve the decryption key by randomly swapping two letters in the key and accepting or rejecting swaps based on the Metropolis probability.

### 5. Accuracy Check (`accuracy_check`)

This function compares the decrypted phrase with the correct answer and calculates the accuracy of the decryption based on the percentage of correctly placed letters.

## Parameter Testing and Results

### 1. Simulated Annealing with Varying Time Constants (ùùâ)

The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by varying the annealing time constant, ùùâ, which controls the rate of cooling. It was found that slower cooling rates (higher ùùâ values) resulted in better accuracy, with a maximum accuracy of 25.58%.

### 2. Accepting Only Positive Proposals

When only positive swaps were accepted, the algorithm consistently got stuck in local maxima, yielding an accuracy rate of 9.3%. This result highlights the importance of accepting negative swaps to escape local optima.

### 3. Varying the Probability of Accepting Negative Proposals

By adjusting the probability of accepting negative swaps, it was determined that a balance between rejecting and accepting negative swaps is crucial. Extreme probabilities (either too high or too low) reduced the decryption accuracy.

### 4. Varying Probability Calculation Methods

Different methods of calculating the total probability (addition, multiplication, and logarithmic addition) were tested. The addition method provided the highest accuracy (25.58%), while the multiplication method resulted in 0% accuracy due to the small magnitude of individual probabilities.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of simulated annealing in cryptography to optimize a decryption key. Through testing various parameters, an optimal solution was found that maximizes the decryption accuracy based on a transition matrix derived from the English language.
